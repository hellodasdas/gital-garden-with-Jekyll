# [Facebook Conversion vs Value Optimization Ad Delivery - DimNiko Agency](https://dimniko.com/blog/facebook-conversion-vs-value-optimization-ad-delivery/)

Today I’d like to share with you a piece of strategy that I’ve been testing the past week. It might be too early to make any assumptions and each business is different but could be worth a try. I started testing the optimization ad delivery conversion vs value again, last time I tested this, it wasn’t successful but now I see better results.

## How to Set Up

So here is the deal: 4 testing campaigns in total – but surely you can add more. Two campaigns for the top of the funnel including the same 3 to 5 ad sets, Lookalikes and broad interests. It’s up to you what type of audiences you’d like to add, it can be only Lookalikes if you prefer.

One of the campaigns is set to optimizing for conversion and the other for value – the only difference is that the campaign which is optimizing for value will be switched to value-based lookalikes. As a side note, soon anyway it will be obligatory to use only value-based lookalikes with value optimization. The daily budget shouldn’t be more than twice your CPA (the product I am testing is a low ticket item so I didn’t have to spend much).

Once the winning campaigns are found for the top of the funnel you can start scaling them. Two campaigns for retargeting as well and the same strategy applies. The audiences you’d like to retarget should be segmented in 3 to 5 ad sets as per your preference and one campaign should be set for conversion optimization and the other for value optimization.

Note: these campaigns should be tested with proven creatives!

## What Were the Results?

The results I got so far based on the optimization event is the following: Top of the funnel value optimization didn’t show good results yet CTRs are low and cost per add to cart is double compared to the conversion campaign.

On retargeting however, the value optimization shows better results compared to the conversion. If you have tested this recently let us know what were the results you’ve got and if you are going to implement it – we would love to hear what was the outcome.
